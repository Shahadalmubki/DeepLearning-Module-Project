# DeepLearning-Module-
Proceeding from the vision of 2030 in afforestation, where many projects have been launched, including Green Riyadh, Green Neighborhoods, King Salman Park and others.


We as a data science community aim to develop the field of plant data analysis in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture.
Based on the data that we have, we identified the types of diseases of the plants , either healthy, rust, scab, or multiple diseases, using Deep Learning, providing a diagnostic service about the type of plant disease through a image of it that can be attached to the website that was created.
We aim to work in the future to have the website contain studies on data on local plants such as palms, dates, saffron, etc., as well as ways to treat them. It will also be a website to educate people about plants and their importance in their lives, such as holding a big event for adults and children such as trips to planting and learning about the types of leaves and more.
